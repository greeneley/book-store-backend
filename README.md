# Book Store

## Description

The E-Commerce Database Management System (EC-DBMS) is designed to store, process, retrieve, and analyze data related to online sales activities conducted by customers from home. The system maintains information about customers, vendors, products, product categories, orders, and couriers. It allows vendors to create online stores, customers to browse products, and administrators to approve or reject shop requests while managing shop categories. The system tracks items in each shop and facilitates online purchases without the need for customers to visit physical stores. This online shopping platform relies on the internet as the primary means of selling goods and services, displaying products in a categorized format. Customers can view product details, check prices, and place orders using their registered accounts, with payment made upon delivery.
